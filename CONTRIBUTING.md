## Proposing Features

The main use case for this project is around batching queries
for GraphQL8 requests, but is open to changes that make it more
generic. This includes supporting concurrent or parallel executors.

When in doubt about whether we will be interested in including a
new feature in this project, please open an issue to propose the
feature so we can confirm the feature should be in scope for the
project before it is implemented.
